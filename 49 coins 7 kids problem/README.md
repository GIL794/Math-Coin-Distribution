# Coin Distribution Problem Solver

This repository provides a solution in Python to the following problem:

> A father has 7 children and 49 coins, each coin weighs 1g more than the previous (i.e., coins weigh from 1g to 49g). Each kid should receive a maximum of 7 coins, and the **sum of the weights** must be the same for each child. No one gets more or fewer coins or any difference in total weight.

## How It Works

The code computes valid distributions (if possible) matching the conditions above.

## Usage

Clone the repository and run:
python coin_distributor.py
It will print the solution or state if there is none.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- No external dependencies.

## How to Contribute
